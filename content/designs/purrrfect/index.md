##### A companion app for new cat parents to help them know their cat better.

## Original Idea
Our design set out to address difficulties encountered by pet parents in general. And our research brought us to the discovery that pet parents experience the most difficulties and expend the most energy and effort with their pets during the initial stages –  because they are still unfamiliar with their pets personalities and individual traits, they struggle to decipher their unexpected behavior and figure out what to do in response.

To address this problem, we set out to create a hardware-focused visual behavioral analysis product that would be worn by pets. It would provide pet parents with real-time data on their cat's behavior. The device would be worn by the cat and would monitor metrics like activity levels, sleeping patterns, and eating habits, and provide behavioral analysis with a built-in camera. The device would then send this data to an app on the pet parent's phone, allowing them to monitor their cat's behavior and make informed decisions about their pet's well-being.


## Evolution
After conducting feasibility research, we realized that the hardware-focused approach was not practical. Instead, we pivoted towards creating a more usable knowledge base and health+behavioral monitoring app. At its core is an asymptotically searchable knowledge base that would help new cat parents identify behaviors accurately even if they do not know the behavior, and then provide insights and suggest actions. for pet parents on how to better understand their cat's behavior. We also added health and behavioral monitoring features to the software, allowing pet parents to track things like their cat's weight, eating habits, and exercise levels.

During the design process, we conducted user testing to gather feedback on our system. We received feedback on the implementation aspect of our search and behavioral dashboard, and made changes to improve the user experience. We also learned that pet parents preferred a simpler, more streamlined approach to accessing information and tracking their cat's behavior. As a result, we made changes to the user interface to make it more intuitive and user-friendly.

## Key Functions
### Vital & Behavior Monitoring
Purrrfect employs IoT and AI to continuously monitor cats' activities, behaviors, and health in real-time, providing pet owners with insights to improve their cats' well-being.

### Kattiepedia 
Purrrfect will have a database that allows users to asymptotically approach and contextualize a cat’s behaviors to provide faster, more effortless search, and more accurate results. It contains a wealth of information on a variety of feline behaviors, including but not limited to vocalizations, body language, and grooming habits.

### Cat Diary
Users' findings from monitoring their cats or using Kattiepedia are recorded in a comprehensive diary for each cat, which can be easily shared with a veterinarian to provide a detailed and up-to-date report of the cat's status. This diary enables vets to customize the best solution for each cat based on their unique behavior and health needs. By having access to this information, cat owners can ensure that their cats receive the best possible care.
